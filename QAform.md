# Week3challenge

## -What was the challenge?
 Create a Jenkins pipeline that takes this [app](https://gitlab.com/qacdevops/nbs-challenge-3) and on every push to the repository (GITHUB), tests the app, creates the docker image and pushes the image to a Nexus repository.
## -How I expected the challenge to go.
I was prepared for the worst as I have faced a few issues with my VM but I think overall, it went well.
## -What went well?
I think I understood the logic behind it a lot easier not sure if the execution is correct however, I felt I have struggled less. 
## -What didn't go as planned?
I did run into a few issues as the connection failed a few times.
## -Possible improvements for future challenges.
Keep on praticising more.
